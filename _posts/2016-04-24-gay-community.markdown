### Gay Chat Line Under Trump 
Trump's election as a president of United State brings an uncertainty to Gay people in the US. It sent panic through much of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, which for the first time in eight years will face an administration hostile to its civil rights goals and a president-elect who has expressed a desire to reverse many of its political gains. Some people are quit optimistic on Trumple's atitudes towards gay communities, while others are angst. Given so many nagitive things toward gay people happened this year, some of them are as horrible as Florida night club, we need to keep eyes on changes that are going to happen.
